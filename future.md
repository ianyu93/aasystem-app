# **Future Development**

The AASystem is only the beginning of what I'm building. After pushing the scripts and documentation onto GitHub, I plan to:

1. Further research and develop data, indicators, and architecture to improve the performance for quarterly forecast, up to June 30, 2021.
2. Develop asset selectors to pick assets in each of the market. Essentially, if 30% is allocated to the stock market, I still need a selector to tell me what to buy with that 30%.
3. Sub-Asset Allocator at the asset level, which is confined within a single market. Say I pick 5 stocks with the 30% of resources allocated, how should I allocate the weighting of each stock?
